            A much exciting gameweek has come to a close yet again! We now continue moving forward with new updates (like the return of the Robot) and the continuous exits of teams in AFCON and Asia Cup, opening up many possibilities for us. The many results in the other domestic competitions also provide opportunities through Double and Blank Gameweeks. Without further ado, let us take a look at the results of GW22!
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Dylan (LiVARpool): 87</li>
            <li>Wei Jian (Fuyoh FC): 74</li>
            <li>Zhen Guang (NIIIIIIIIIIIII): 60</li>
            <li>Kai He (Cristoph Kuku): 57</li>
            <li>Fu Qiang (UNICORN): 52</li>
            <li>Glenn (Hairy Minguire): 49</li>
            <li>??? (PoundProliferater): 43</li>
            <li>Basil (PlantaDollar): 43</li>
            <li>Eu Ren (Jacob RamsMe): 40</li>
            <li>Wei Jun (MBAPPÉNIS): 39</li>
            <li>Hong Ju (wayme): 39</li>
            <li>Shaun (DQMM): 36</li>
          </ol>

            Moving onto the next section, the Fraud Report.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bukayo Saka </strong>(ARS, MID, £9.1m)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Erling Haaland, with many predicting a big return for the Viking, may be due for a timely fraud this week. BRE are looking to beat them for the third consecutive time after doing it twice last season, and the Robot does need to shake off some rust before playing. His start may not be absolutely guaranteed as well as Pep may choose to bench him and play the in-form Alvarez instead. With the large number of people bringing him in, he may be one to have an adverse result instead.
            <br /><br />
            With only one candidate for Fraud Report once again, I move on to the headlines of GW22!

            <strong>A massive win for MUN! Despite nearly bottling it, MUN manage to scrape through from the depths for a needed three points!</strong>
            <br /><br />
            MUN and WOL had a massively hard fought game at the Molineux Stadium. What was a 2-0 lead for MUN, snowballed to a 3-1 lead then suddenly a 3-3 equaliser in additional time! However, the youngster Mainoo calmly took the ball past multiple defenders to slot the game-winner into the bottom corner. What a clinical and perfect finish to the game. 
            <br /><br />
            <strong>LIV shows who’s boss! Anfield proves to not be an easy feat for CHE!</strong>
            <br /><br />
            A 5-goal thriller and trashing by LIV shows nothing but the difference between the quality between the two teams. With LIV managing 28 shots and 13 on target compared to CHE managing 4 shots and 3 on target, it seems obvious that the scoreline was rather deserved. The youngster Conor Bradley shone in the game, scoring a goal and assisting two others in typical Trent fashion. Indeed an exciting game full of action and one to remember.
            <br /><br />
            Just my $0.02 for this week. All the best for all the managers for GW23!
