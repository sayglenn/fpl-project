            After a long-drawn out gameweek spanning over two weeks, GW22 finally comes to a close, with many unexpected and interesting results. AFCON and Asia Cup are in full swing now, with many sudden injuries and exits from the cups leading to possible returns (or non-returns) to the club. Without further ado, let me present the results for GW22!
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Wei Jun (MBAPPÉNIS): 76</li>
            <li>Eu Ren (Jacob RamsMe): 75</li>
            <li>Zhen Guang (NIIIIIIIIIIIII): 70</li>
            <li>Wei Jian (Fuyoh FC): 61</li>
            <li>Fu Qiang (UNICORN): 57</li>
            <li>Hong Ju (wayme): 56</li>
            <li>Glenn (Hairy Minguire): 54</li>
            <li>Kai He (Cristoph Kuku): 52</li>
            <li>Shaun (DQMM): 45</li>
            <li>Dylan (LiVARpool): 38</li>
            <li>??? (PoundProliferater): 34</li>
            <li>Basil (PlantaDollar): 27</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Now, I will move onto the next section, the Fraud Report.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bukayo Saka </strong>(ARS, MID, £9.1m)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As usual, Bukayo Saka displayed a world-class frauding performance again, serving up 3 points in a 5-0 win over CRY. A captaincy choice for many, including myself. It was highly unfortunate that he had no goal involvement at all, but considering his current play style and the way Arteta employs him, it is no surprise that he is prone to lower goal involvements. Coming up against a struggling team in NFO, he may be a prime candidate to put up a fraudulent performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, I have only one candidate for Fraud Report this week, and I will subsequently move on to the pointers for GW22.

            <strong>A riveting draw between MUN and TOT! The two teams walk away with a point each after a hard-fought battle!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A tight game between the two teams at Old Trafford, which begun with Rasmus Hojlund powering a shot with his left foot past Vicario while being closed down. Although MUN took the lead once again after Richarlison’s equaliser, it was not enough as Bentancur scored the second goal for TOT to bring it to a draw for both teams. Quite an attacking game for both ends which looked to bring more goals than the end result.

            <strong>Dramatic scenes at St James Park! MCI comes out on top in injury time!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            An exciting match seen between two sides comes out as a victory for the reigning champions as Oscar Bobb scores a last minute winner for MCI. Kevin de Bruyne made an instant impact for MCI on his return, registering a goal and an assist. His presence was dearly missed as he made an instant impact to win the game from a losing position. MCI may be a force to be reckoned with as they may make a charge for the title for the 4th consecutive title.

            Just my $0.02 for this week. All the best for all the managers for GW22!
