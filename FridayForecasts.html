            Hello again to all good sirs! A very quick turnaround this week as the Prem kicks back into action following the winter break, with GW23 coming around this weekend, and hence its accompanying Friday Forecast:
            <br /><br />
            <strong style="border-top: solid 2px; border-bottom: solid 2px;">Game of the Weekend</strong>: ARS vs LIV
            <br /><br />
            A second big game in a week for LIV as they travel to the Emirates to face fellow title hopefuls ARS.
            <br /><br /> 
            ARS have been playing well since their trip to Dubai, following up a 5-0 win against CRY with a 2-1 win against NFO, in which they controlled large parts of the game but lost concentration to allow Taiwo Awoniyi in on goal. While such lapses have been the bane of ARS's form this season, their improved output in front of goal, in line with Gabriel Jesus' sudden ability to score goals, will give ARS a real threat this weekend. 
            <br /><br />
            LIV's statement win against a CHE team on the up this week was one of real title intent, as they tore apart the CHE defence time and again to devestating effect. Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez were at it once again, while Conor Bradley was the star of the show with his energy down the right flank. With LIV's surprising strength in depth, and their performances seemingly charged by Jurgen Klopp's imminent departure, this game will be a tough one to call, but it should be noted that LIV have already done a number on ARS with a 2-0 win in the FA Cup. 
            <br /><br />
            <strong style="border-top: solid 2px; border-bottom: solid 2px;">Big Favourites</strong>: NIL
            <br /><br />
            In its place, there shall be 2 games in Potential Upset.
            <br /><br />
            <strong style="border-top: solid 2px; border-bottom: solid 2px;">Potential Upset</strong>: BRE vs MCI // LUT vs BHA
            <br /><br />
            The first of this section is one which may seem odd, considering the form of both teams, but it is worth noting that BRE did the double over the treble-winning MCI team of last season. 
            <br /><br />
            MCI have been dominant since the return of Kevin De Bruyne, and with Erling Haaland's return adding more firepower to an already fearsome MCI front line, it is difficult to say who can stop this team right now.
            <br /><br />
            But if anyone could, it would be their bogey team in BRE, who are seasoned professionals in the art of a low block, and have the master of black magic Ivan Toney back, who has scored 2 "outrageous" goals in his last 2 games. BRE have not been shy of scoring, being involved in 3 3-2 games in a row, and if they can introduce that chaos into this game against MCI, anything could happen. 
            <br /><br />
            The second game here is an interesting one. 
            <br /><br />
            NEW have not been convincing recently, but going to Villa Park and scoring 3 goals is something no other team has done this season, even if 2 of those goals were from Fabian Schar. An injury to Alexander Isak would not have been ideal, with Callum Wilson still sidelined, but NEW have goals all across the squad, and it seems like keeping them out has been their bigger issue this season. 
            <br /><br />
            LUT come off of an resounding victory against BHA, thumping their visitors 4-0 at home. While Kenilworth Road has become somewhat of a fortress, LUT have not been too poor on their travels either, and seem to have found the right formula to score goals through their two big strikers in Carlton Morris and Elijah Adebayo. 
            <br /><br />
            LUT have already beaten NEW this season, and it would be real upset if they could repeat it at St. James Park.

          <p>
            <strong style="border-top: solid 2px; border-bottom: solid 2px;">Too Close to Call</strong>: MUN vs WHU
            <br /><br />
            While the reverse fixture was not great for MUN, they have found a new run of form in line with the goalscoring antics of Rasmus Hojlund, who has been finding the back of the net in the Prem of late. Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho have also been providing some much needed spark to the MUN front line, and if they can solve their issues defensively, they could have a push for top 4 in the second half of the season, starting with this game.
            <br /><br />
            WHU have not been great either, with the loss of Lucas Paqueta and Mohammed Kudus impacting their goal-scoring threat. However, with the latter returning from AFCON and winning the penalty to gain WHU a point against BOU, WHU could return back to the free-scoring team we saw before the winter break. 
            <br /><br />
            An enthralling encounter awaits...
            <br /><br />
            <strong style="border-top: solid 2px; border-bottom: solid 2px;">Others:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              EVE vs TOT could be a close one, with EVE's back-to-back clean sheets going up against TOT's free scoring front line. EVE's pacey front line could also catch out a high TOT defence.
            </li>
            <li>
              BHA vs CRY is another tough one to call, as neither team is truly on or off form, seeming to yo-yo between great wins and disappointing losses. With Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze going off injured however, BHA could have a slight advantage, although they are also missing in-form front man Joao Pedro.
            </li>
            <li>
              BUR vs FUL should be advantage FUL, but with neither side all too convincing in front of goal, this will be hard to call.
            </li>
            <li>
              SHU vs AVL sees a AVL side who want to put aside the embarassment at Villa Park the other night, but travel away to the team that ended their home winning streak, whose new signing Ben Brereton Diaz seems to be in scintillating form. 
            </li>
            <li>
              BOU vs NFO seems like goals aplenty, with both sides in form in front of goal. Dominic Solanke will be BOU's danger man, but look out for returning NFO forward Taiwo Awoniyi, who returned from injury in style with a goal against ARS. 
            </li>
            <li>
              CHE vs WOL looks a great game with many goals as well. Look out for CHE's creator-in-chief Cole Palmer, as well as returning centre-forward Christopher Nkunku, while for WOL, Pedro Neto has continued the great run he was on before his injury. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong style="border-top: solid 2px; border-bottom: solid 2px;">Captaincy</strong>: 
            <br /><br />
            MCI's Kevin De Bruyne is a shout for captaincy this week, starting his first Prem game against BUR, and returning in 3 of the 4 games he's been involved in since his return from injury. 
            In-form strikers Dominic Solanke (BOU) and Ollie Watkins (AVL) are also shouts, with decently good fixtures this gameweek. 
            <br /><br />
            Thats all I have for this week's Friday Forecasts! All the best to all managers as we navigate yet another gameweek in our journey to become the best versions of our FPL selves.
