      <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        This website was created with the purpose of simplifying and centralising content within a single website for easy access for other players in our mini-league. This is a simple project intending to implement certain features of API usage to provide live updates onto the website.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        Currently, the backend is still a work in progress as more functionality and design is being added onto the website. As we move on to expand the project, any feedback wlll be much appreciated!

          I mostly handle the structure of the website, building all of the front-end elements from scratch using basic HTML and CSS to format the website correctly and ensure readability of the website is well accounted for.

          I enjoy playing Fantasy Football and have been following the Premier League for about 12 years now. I was inspired to make this website as part of my interest towards the game of Fantasy Football and to test my abilities in developing a website.
