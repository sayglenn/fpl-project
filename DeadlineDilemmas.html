            Good afternoon fellow experts and analysts, welcome to Deadline Dilemmas for GW23! A rapid turnaround from the midweek games sees us head right into a weekend full of footy action. As the deadline is quite near, today's report will aim to be succinct and concise...
            <br /><br />
            <strong style="border-top: solid 2px; border-bottom: solid 2px;">Picks of the Week</strong>:
            <br /><br />
            EVE host TOT at the notoriously raucous Goodison Park. Expect a tight game where EVE will create many chances for themselves. DCL to grab a goal while Vicario to get many save points...
            <br /><br />
            BHA vs CRY is a traditionally tight affair. Clean sheet for either side can be expected unless it ends 1-1, where the goals could come from Eze and Welbeck...
            <br /><br />
            CHE take on bogey team WOL and this will be an end to end affair perfect for speedy counter attackers in Neto and Sterling. Palmer an interesting captaincy option...
            <br /><br />
            MCI also face bogey team BRE who always give the Citizens a tough time out. Toney will continue to frustrate the City defence and hopefully be involved in a goal or two. MCI will cause trouble for a disciplined BRE defence as well, with Foden (if he starts) to be a constant threat with his smart movement and dangerous shooting ability...
            <br /><br />
            BOU vs NFO should be an attacking affair, with the hosts prime to target NFO's weak central area by feeding balls to Solanke. Do keep an eye on Tavernier and Scott, who are chief creators in the attack as well...
            <br /><br />
            That's it for this week, do remember to set your teams before the 7pm deadline!
